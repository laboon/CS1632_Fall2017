* Given a problem, be able to make a truth table
* Understand what a covering array is
* Be able to make a simple covering array
* Be able to determine what pairs are not being tested by a covering array

## WEB TESTING
* Be able to explain how you would test a web page with Selenium
* Understand how you should NOT test a web page
